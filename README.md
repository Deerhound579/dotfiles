# My Setup

Quickly set up my favorite working environment wherever I go.

## MacOS

  ```shell
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```

* Shell: zsh

  * Font: Fira Code
  
I use [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) as the plugin manager. All plugins are in `dot.antigenrc`

Configurations for Zsh are stored in my `dot.zshrc` file.
